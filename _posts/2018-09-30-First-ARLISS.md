This summer has been an amazing experience. Our group has gone through so much.  We have faced many challenges and were able to overcome them. We started late June with a vague idea of what the ARLISS competition consisted of. We spent the next couple of weeks testing designs, researching, testing materials, working with different microcontrollers and improving our knowledge. When we discovered a material was weak, or a design was not as strong as it could be, we pushed forward. We continued testing until August when we really had to bring everything together. We had some small issues along the way and had to redesign the rover, but through teamwork we were able to overcome.
    After the long drive to the Nevada desert we set up camp and awaited our turn to launch our robot with the rocket. The morning we planned on launching the robot Murphy's law was in full effect. Every piece of our robot, from the microcontroller to the motors, had issues. If our team was any less wonderful, we may not have launched. That day we went from having a high tech paperweight to a fully functional rover. 
    The day of the launch we waited with anticipation as the robot launched. We drove around the desert to find our rover, eventually finding it tangled in the parachute cord, but still moving (or at least attempting to move). We had done it though; the rover survived the rocket launch, landing, and had moved. A rush of excitement went over all of us as we could see our work over the summer paying off.
This has been such an amazing experience. I want to thank everyone involved : Chase, Alonzo, Daniel, Derek , Jake , Linshu , Luyao, Miguel , Noah and a special thank you to Dean Walton for your guidance, advice, and passion. This experience has left us with so many memories.
