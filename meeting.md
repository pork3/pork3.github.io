>> + Share findings between teams
>> + Update everyone involved on progress
>> + Hone our experience to create the best rover we can 

>> The Team Meetings are use to:
>> + Work together to build a unique design
>> + Design and create components
>> + Share findings with each other

### Schedule:
> Club meetings : Second and fourth Thursday in Science Library, check [Twitter](https://twitter.com/uoarliss) for room.

> Team meetings: These are decided with your team, we use [Discord](https://discord.gg/JhGFX8) to coordinate these, so joining and talking with your team will be the fastest way to jump in.
